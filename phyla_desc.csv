phyla_name,descAcidobacteria,Actinobacteria,"Actinobacteria, which are so important to a healthy microbiome that we can even take probiotic supplements of them, are the most common microbes on our skin and are commensal to our mouths and genitals too."Aquificae,Archaea unclassified,Armatimonadetes,Ascomycota,Bacteria candidate phyla unclassified,Bacteria unclassified,Bacteroidetes,"Members of the diverse bacterial phylum Bacteroidetes have colonized virtually all types of habitats on Earth. Bacteroidetes are increasingly regarded as specialists for the degradation of high molecular weight organic matter, i.e., proteins and carbohydrates. "Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi group unclassified,Candidate division CPR1,Candidate division CPR3,Candidate division WWE3,Candidate division Zixibacteria,Candidatus Adlerbacteria,Candidatus Aerophobetes,Candidatus Atribacteria,Candidatus Azambacteria,Candidatus Beckwithbacteria,Candidatus Berkelbacteria,Candidatus Calescamantes,Candidatus Campbellbacteria,Candidatus Dadabacteria,Candidatus Daviesbacteria,Candidatus Falkowbacteria,Candidatus Fervidibacteria,Candidatus Gottesmanbacteria,Candidatus Hydrogenedentes,Candidatus Jorgensenbacteria,Candidatus Kuenenbacteria,Candidatus Levybacteria,Candidatus Magasanikbacteria,Candidatus Microgenomates,Candidatus Moranbacteria,Candidatus Nanohaloarchaeota,Candidatus Nomurabacteria,Candidatus Pacebacteria,Candidatus Parcubacteria,Candidatus Peregrinibacteria,Candidatus Poribacteria,Candidatus Roizmanbacteria,Candidatus Saccharibacteria,Newly discovered phylum. Common in human oral cavity. Candidatus Uhrbacteria,Candidatus Woesebacteria,Candidatus Wolfebacteria,Chlamydiae,Chloroflexi,Chrysiogenetes,Cloacimonetes,Crenarchaeota,Cyanobacteria,Cyanobacteria/Melainabacteria group unclassified,DPANN group unclassified,Deferribacteres,Deinococcus-Thermus,Dikarya unclassified,Elusimicrobia,Eukaryota unclassified,Euryarchaeota,FCB group unclassified,Fibrobacteres,Firmicutes,"Many Firmicutes produce endospores, which are resistant to desiccation and can survive extreme conditions.    They are found in various environments, and the group includes some notable pathogens."Fungi unclassified,Fusobacteria,"Fusobacteria are enriched in the saliva of healthy, non-obese folks, and are abundant in the airways of healthy people but not of Cystic Fibrosis sufferers.Small populations of Fusobacteria commonly inhabit our urine, gut, mouth, and lungs."Gemmatimonadetes,Latescibacteria,Marinimicrobia,Microgenomates group unclassified,Nanoarchaeota,Nitrospinae,Nitrospinae/Tectomicrobia group unclassified,Nitrospirae,Nonspecific/Host,Omnitrophica,Opisthokonta unclassified,PVC group unclassified,Parcubacteria group unclassified,Patescibacteria group unclassified,Planctomycetes,Proteobacteria,"Along with Firmicutes, Proteobacteria are the most common gut microbes in Westerners.Although all of us carry these microbes, folks with inflammatory bowel disease seem to have more Proteobacteria and fewer varieties of other bacteria.Interestingly, the proportional representation of Proteobacteria increases dramatically in the digestive tracts of pregnant women in their third trimester. Fun fact: because Proteobacteria come in a myriad of structures and shapes, they were named after the shape-shifting Greek god, Proteus."Spirochaetes,Many organisms within the Spirochaetes phylum are causative agents of prevalent diseases. Spirochetes may also cause dementia and may be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.Synergistetes,TACK group unclassified,Tenericutes,Terrabacteria group unclassified,Thaumarchaeota,Thermodesulfobacteria,Thermotogae,Unclassified Bacteria unclassified,Verrucomicrobia,"This is a recently discovered phylum, with a wart-like cell shape. Interestingly, Verrucomicrobia have been found to be elevated in hibernating squirrels and in some people after antibiotic treatment. There are no known pathogens in this group."
